# gluten

Utility library for Go, mostly focused around higher level concurrency
datatypes.

## Installation and Usage

The import path for the package is *github.com/hypirion/gluten* (NS: All in
lowercase).

To install it, run:

```shell
go get github.com/hypirion/gluten
```

I'll attempt to make this backwards compatible, but there's no guarantee that
this will be held. Please use [Glide](http://glide.sh/)
or [Dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to lock the current version to your
application.
